## Android Debug Bridge (adb)

It is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device.The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps. adb provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device.


1. **Client**: Sends commands. The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a command-line terminal by issuing an `adb` command.
2. **Daemon (adbd)**: Runs commands on a device. The daemon runs as a background process on each device. The daemon on the Android device connects with the server on the host PC over USB or TCP, which connects to the client that is used by the end-user over TCP.
3. **Server**: Manages communication between the client and the daemon. The server runs as a background process on your development machine. The default port number on which the `adb` server runs is 5037.

 adb is included in the Android SDK Platform Tools package, which is installed at `${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools/`

After the PATH environment variable is set appropriately, we verify the program execution by typing adb in the terminal
