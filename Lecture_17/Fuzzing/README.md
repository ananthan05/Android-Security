## Fuzzing

“fuzzing” technique to test the security and vulnerabilities of crypto libraries in Android applications.

The tools used for fuzzing in this lecture include

1. **OSS-Fuzz:** Continuous Fuzzing Service for Open Source Software
2. **ClusterFuzz:** Scalable Fuzzing Infrastructure
3. **FuzzBench:** Fuzzer benchmarking as a service

which are automated processes used by Google for open-source projects.

Fuzzing involves testing the behavior and vulnerabilities of functions by manipulating inputs, such as strings or images.
